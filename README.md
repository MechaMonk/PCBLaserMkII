# PCB Laser MKII

Mechanical and electrical design files for revised version.

NOTE: design is in a tentative state - it is not yet verified.

Features:

Closed enclosure made from laser-cut acrylic

Some (one?) 3D-printer part(s)

Belt driven axes (Y-axis might be changed to screw)

Small Nema 17 motors

Near 1200 DPI resolution

Laser driver electronics mounted on laser head

Cheap?

File formats:

Inkscape (laser cut parts),
FreeCAD (3D-printed parts),
KiCad (electronics, PCBs)

GCode? DXF?

I am using Vetric software for generating GCode for my laser cutter/engraver so I may publish files in this format too.

BOM:

TBA
